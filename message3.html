            <span class="highlight"> In the data structure of my heart, you're the key </span> <br>
            A pointer to the memory of love's sweet decree. <br>
            With each connection, our hearts are intertwined, <br>
            A linked list of moments, love's code, well-defined. <br>
            <br>
            Your presence is like an array that arrays my dreams, <br>
            In the index of my life, you're the one that gleams. <br>
            Your love, a recursive function, eternally calls, <br>
            In the algorithm of affection, our love enthralls. <br>
            <br>
            Together we merge like nodes in a tree, <br>
            A linked list of emotions, forever to be. <br>
            <span class="highlight"> With you, my love, I've found the perfect node, </span> <br>
            In this code of affection, our hearts will erode. <br>
            <br>
            We're like a database, storing moments so sweet, <br>
            <span class="highlight"> In the memory cache of my soul, your love's complete. </span> <br>
            As we traverse the paths of life, hand in hand, <br>
            Our love's a program, perfectly planned. <br>
            <br>
            So let's compile our love, let it run its course, <br>
            An endless loop of affection, our love's the source. <br>
            In this code of emotions, you're the center and base, <br>
            Forever in my heart, you've found your rightful place. <br>
