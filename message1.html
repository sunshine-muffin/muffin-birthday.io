            <h1> Why you're Special? </h1>
            <p class="paragraph"> <mark class="marker"> Hi Muffin</mark>.I think a woman merely represents an art, that she doesn't need to appear beautiful. But, she needs to make you feel something and so you did. <mark class="marker">Whenever I see you, it feels like a cold breeze hitting on a warm evening.
                 You feel charismatic, peculiar and hypnotic. </mark> You remember the day I took a pic with you (January 13, 3.39pm IST), it actually took a lot of courage to ask you for a pic. I still consider that pic one of my greatest achievements.
                Since the day we met, we never had a friendly conversation. Every time, it's either me debating against you/you scolding me. I think that this message could resolve the conflicts between us.
                <br>
                <br>
                Now, let's have a look at some real world examples of how your existence makes me feel good;
                <br>
                <br>
                The image below depicts how you look when you're angry. You try so hard to be terrific that you're not. <mark class="marker"> You appear like a precious floof when you're angry, </mark> a child being cute angry for not getting chocolate, or a precious kitten that woke up in a half sleep being angry at its owner.
                <br>
                <img src="css/precious_floof.jpg" alt="you're a precious floof" style="width: 250px;height: 200px;" class="center"/>
                <br>
                The video below is an mp4 representation of how I feel when you talk with me;
                <br>
                <br>
                <video width="500" height="250" controls class="center">
                    <source src="css/you_care.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
                </video>
                <br>
                Finally, I want to say that;
                <br>
                <img src="css/duck_love.jpg" alt="just kidding" style="width: 230px; height: 300px;" class="center"/>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                You might ask why I'm still doing these things, because once a wise man said;
                    <div class="center">
                        <p> தெய்வத்தான் ஆகா தெனினும் முயற்சிதன் <br>
                            மெய்வருத்தக் கூலி தரும். </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Even though God be against, Effort is bound to pay the wages of labour.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            यद्यपि मिले न दैववश, इच्छित फल जो भोग्य | <br>
                            श्रम देगा पारिश्रमिक, निज देह-श्रम-योग्य
                        </p>
                    </div>
            </p>
